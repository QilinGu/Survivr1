1. How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
I used define_method to create multiple medthods from a color hash, which is pretty neat.
2. How long did you spend working on this project?
About 3 hours in total including the README and reflections.
3. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
No particular challenges. Genrally finishing the project is pretty rewarding, and it helps me shift my way of writing code.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Metaprogramming is great, but enabling users to define their own methods could be double-sided. So I really need to get better understanding of all the concepts and best practices before using it in my own projects.
